The beginning of the tasks always is to install the tools properly.
To log the session: script session.log // the name of log file doesn't necessary be session.log. And enter 'exit' to end the session.log
There are two log files in the RepoMeta:
* session1.log records the VCS practice with Git in the terminal
* session2.log records the VCS practice with SVN in the terminal
In my opinion, Git is easier to use than SVN. For example, SVN has insufficient repository management commands. There are some useful Git commands that I used frequently:
*Clone -> Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github into a folder on your local machine
*Add -> Track your files and changes in Git
*Status -> Check your current status for any files and changes in Git
*Commit -> Save your files in Git
*Push -> Upload Git commits to a remote repo, like Github
*Pull -> Download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push
In addition, Git has a faster operation speed comparing to SVN. However, SVN provides a good documentation that covers documentation for developers as well as administrators, and it's very stable and used by most developer. Both of Git and SVN are free.
